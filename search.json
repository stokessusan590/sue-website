      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nby Susan C. Stokes, Thad Dunning, Marcelo Nazareno, and Valeria Brusco \nCambridge University Press, 2013\nPurchase here\nBrokers, Voters, and Clientelism addresses major questions in distributive politics. Why is it acceptable for parties to try to win elections by promising to make certain groups of people better off, but unacceptable - and illegal - to pay people for their votes? Why do parties often lavish benefits on loyal voters, whose support they can count on anyway, rather than on responsive swing voters? Why is vote buying and machine politics common in today’s developing democracies but a thing of the past in most of today’s advanced democracies? This book develops a theory of broker-mediated distribution to answer these questions, testing the theory with research from four developing democracies, and reviews a rich secondary literature on countries in all world regions. The authors deploy normative theory to evaluate whether clientelism, pork-barrel politics, and other non-programmatic distributive strategies can be justified on the grounds that they promote efficiency, redistribution, or voter participation.\nWinner, 2014 Luebbert Best Book Award, Comparative Politics Section, American Political Science Association\nCo-Winner, 2014 Best Book Award, Comparative Democratization Section, American Political Science Association\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nEdited by Adam Przeworski, Susan C. Stokes, and Bernard Manin \nCambridge University Press, 1999\nPurchase here\nThis book examines whether the mechanisms of accountability characteristic of democratic systems are sufficient to induce the representatives to act in the best interest of the represented. The first part of the volume focuses on the role of elections, distinguishing different ways in which they may cause representation. The second part is devoted to the role of checks and balances, between the government and the parliament as well as between the government and the bureaucracy. The contributors of this volume, all leading scholars in the fields of American and comparative politics and political theory, address questions such as, whether elections induce governments to act in the interest of citizens. Are politicians in democracies accountable to voters in future elections? If so, does accountability induce politicians to represent citizens? Does accountability limit or enhance the scope of action of governments? Are governments that violate campaign mandates representative? Overall, the essays combine theoretical discussions, game-theoretic models, case studies, and statistical analyses, within a shared analytical approach and a standardized terminology. The empirical material is drawn from the well established democracies as well as from new democracies.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nEdited by Samuel Amaral and Susan C. Stokes \nEditorial de la Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero, 2005\nPurchase here\nLa calidad de la democracy - su capacidad de provocar la participación de la ciudadanía, de estimular debates y delieración sobra las opcioes que enfrenta un país o una comunidad, de proteger los derechos de los individuos y grupos marginales frente a los grupos de poder, de promover la justicia social - casi siempre se analiza desde la perspectiva de los gobiernos y de los procesos políticos nacionales.\nLa calidad de la democracia, sin embargo, también se advierte muchas veces de manera más cercana en el ámbito local: los ciudadanos estamos en contacto con los partidos políticos frecuentemente a través de dirigentes o candidatos locales, recibimos subsidios y programas sociales a través de los municipios, y estamos inmersos en redes sociales que giran alrededor de nuestro lugar de residencia. Es en ese ámbito, por lo tanto, donde se dan las relaciones más estrechas entre representantes y representados.\nAunque la calidad de la democracia siempre estará ligada a las instituciones, actores y procesos nacionales, también las instituciones, actores y procesos locales influyen profundamente en determinar esa calidad. La democracia, como la vivimos día a día, es también un fenómeno local.\nEste libro estudia la formación de capital social, la práctica del clientelismo, la introducción de la innovación, y otros aspectos de la política tal como se la practica en municipios y localidades de la Argentina. Apunta, más que a denunciar situaciones o proponer soluciones, a llamar la atención sobre una dimensión clave de toda democracia: la democracia local.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nEdited by Margaret Levi, James Johnson, Jack Knight, and Susan Stokes \nRussell Sage Foundation, 2008\nPurchase here\nWhat are the essential elements of a democracy? How can nations ensure a political voice for all citizens, and design a government that will respond to those varied voices? These perennial questions resonate strongly in the midst of ongoing struggles to defend democratic institutions around the world and here at home. In Designing Democratic Government, a group of distinguished political scientists provides a landmark cross-national analysis of the institutions that either facilitate or constrain the healthy development of democracy.\nThe contributors to Designing Democratic Government use the democratic ideals of fairness, competitiveness, and accountability as benchmarks to assess a wide variety of institutions and practices. John Leighly and Jonathan Nagler find that in the U.S., the ability to mobilize voters across socioeconomic lines largely hinges on the work of non-party groups such as civic associations and unions, which are far less likely than political parties to engage in class-biased outreach efforts. Michael McDonald assesses congressional redistricting methods and finds that court-ordered plans and close adherence to the Voting Rights Act effectively increase the number of competitive electoral districts, while politically-drawn maps reduce the number of competitive districts. John Carey and John Polga-Hecimovich challenge the widespread belief that primary elections produce inferior candidates. Analyzing three decades worth of comprehensive data on Latin American presidential campaigns, they find that primaries impart a stamp of legitimacy on candidates, helping to engage voters and mitigate distrust in the democratic process. And Kanchan Chandra proposes a paradigm shift in the way we think about ethnic inclusion in democracies: nations should design institutions that actively promote—rather than merely accommodate—diversity.\nAt a moment when democracy seems vulnerable both at home and abroad, Designing Democratic Government sorts through a complex array of practices and institutions to outline what works and what doesn’t in new and established democracies alike. The result is a volume that promises to change the way we look at the ideals of democracy worldwide.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nEdited by Carles Boix and Susan Stokes \nOxford University Press, 2009\nPurchase here\nThe Oxford Handbook of Comparative Politics offers a critical survey of the field of empirical political science through the collection of a set of articles written by forty-seven scholars in the discipline of comparative politics. Part I includes articles surveying the key research methodologies employed in comparative politics (the comparative method, the use of history, the practice and status of case-study research, and the contributions of field research) and assessing the possibility of constructing a science of comparative politics. Parts II to IV examine the foundations of political order: the origins of states and the extent to which they relate to war and to economic development; the sources of compliance or political obligation among citizens; democratic transitions, the role of civic culture; authoritarianism; revolutions; civil wars and contentious politics. Parts V and VI explore the mobilization, representation, and the coordination of political demands. Part V considers why parties emerge, and the forms they take and the ways in which voters choose parties. The text then includes articles on collective action, social movements, and political participation. Part VI opens with essays on the mechanisms through which political demands are aggregated and coordinated. This sets the agenda to the systematic exploration of the workings and effects of particular institutions: electoral systems, federalism, legislative-executive relationships, the judiciary and bureaucracy. Finally, Part VII is organized around the burgeoning literature on macro-political economy of the last two decades. This Handbook is one of The Oxford Handbooks of Political Science a ten-volume set of reference books offering authoritative and engaging critical overviews of the state of political science.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nby Susan C. Stokes \nCambridge University Press, 2001\nPurchase here\nSometimes politicians run for office promising one set of policies, and if they win, switch to very different ones. Latin American presidents in recent years have frequently run promising to avoid pro-market reforms and harsh economic adjustment, then win and transform immediately into enthusiastic market reformers. Does it matter when politicians ignore the promises they made and the preferences of their constituents? If politicians want to be reelected or see their party reelected at the end of their term, why would they impose unpopular policies? Susan Stokes develops a model of policy switches and tests it with statistical and qualitative data from Latin American elections over the last two decades. She concludes that politicians may change policies because unpopular policies are best for constituents and best serve their own political ambitions. Nevertheless, even though good representatives sometimes switch policies, abrupt change tends to erode the quality of democracy.\nCo-Winner, 2002 Mattei Dogan Foundation Prize in European Political Sociology, Society of Comparative Research\nWinner, 2003 Best Book Award, Comparative Democratization Section, American Political Science Association\nWinner, 2016 George H.

      "contents": "\nEdited by Susan C. Stokes \nCambridge University Press, 2001\nPurchase here\nDo people in new democracies undergoing market reforms turn against these reforms when the economic adjustment is painful? The conventional wisdom is that they will. According to ‘economic voting’ models, citizens punish elected governments for bad economic performance. The contributors to this collection, in contrast, begin with the insight that citizens in new democracies have good reasons to depart from the predictions of economic voting. If they believe the prediction that, with the transition to a market economy, economic conditions must deteriorate before they improve, they may interpret short-term deterioration as signaling that the transition is on course and things will improve in the future. If they perceive that forces from the past are responsible for economic deterioration, they may exonerate the government. With similar data-sets from three new democracies in Europe and three in Latin America, the authors probe the support for governments and economic reforms under economic conditions.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nby Susan C. Stokes \nUniversity of California Press, 1995\nPurchase here\nIn this vivid ethnography set in contemporary Peru, Susan Stokes provides a compelling analysis of the making and unmaking of class consciousness among the urban poor. Her research strategy is multifaceted; through interviews, participant observation, and survey research she digs deeply into the popular culture of the social activists and shantytown residents she studies. The result is a penetrating look at how social movements evolve, how poor people construct independent political cultures, and how the ideological domination of oppressed classes can shatter.\nThis work is a new and vital chapter in the growing literature on the formation of social movements. It chronicles the transformation of Peru’s poor from a culture of deference and clientelism in the late 1960s to a population mobilized for radical political action today.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

Kirshner \nCambridge University Press, 2010\nPurchase here\nPolitical representation lies at the core of modern politics. Democracies, with their vast numbers of citizens, could not operate without representative institutions. Yet relations between the democratic ideal and the everyday practice of political representation have never been well defined and remain the subject of vigorous debate among historians, political theorists, lawyers, and citizens. In this volume, an eminent group of scholars move forward the debates about political representation on a number of fronts. Drawing on insights from political science, history, political theory, economics, and anthropology, the authors provide much-needed clarity to some of the most vexing questions about political representation. They also reveal new and enlightening perspectives on this fundamental political practice. Topics discussed include representation before democracy, political parties, minorities, electoral competition, and ideology. This volume is essential reading for anyone interested in the ideal and the reality of political representation.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nby Matthew R. Cleary and Susan C. Stokes \nRussell Sage Foundation, 2006\nPurchase here\nSome theorists claim that democracy cannot work without trust. According to this argument, democracy fails unless citizens trust that their governing institutions are serving their best interests. Similarly, some assert that democracy works best when people trust one another and have confidence that politicians will look after citizen interests. Questioning such claims, Democracy and the Culture of Skepticism, by Matthew Cleary and Susan Stokes, suggests that skepticism, not trust, is the hallmark of political culture in well-functioning democracies.\nDrawing on extensive research in two developing democracies, Argentina and Mexico, Democracy and the Culture of Skepticism shows that in regions of each country with healthy democracies, people do not trust one another more than those living in regions where democracy functions less well, nor do they display more personal trust in governments or politicians. Instead, the defining features of the healthiest democracies are skepticism of government and a belief that politicians act in their constituents’ best interest only when it is personally advantageous for them to do so. In contrast to scholars who lament what they see as a breakdown in civic life, Cleary and Stokes find that people residing in healthy democracies do not participate more in civic organizations than others, but in fact, tend to retreat from civic life in favor of private pursuits. The authors conclude that governments are most efficient and responsive when they know that institutions such as the press or an independent judiciary will hold them accountable for their actions.\nThe question of how much citizens should trust politicians and governments has consumed political theorists since America’s founding. In Democracy and the Culture of Skepticism, Matthew Cleary and Susan Stokes test the relationship between trust and the quality of governance, showing that it is not trust, but vigilance and skepticism that provide the foundation for well-functioning democracies.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nby Susan C. Stokes \nForthcoming\nIn the past two decades, a growing number of presidents and prime ministers have actively undermined their countries’ democratic institutions. Trash-Talking Democracy offers an explanation for this wave of democratic erosion or backsliding, evidence about how it can be effectively resisted, and ideas about how to repair democratic institutions after the backsliding leader is no longer in power. The manuscript locates the two major flavors of eroding leaders – right-wing ethnonationalists and left-wing populists – in the historical context of late- 20th-century shifts in party politics, and explains why income inequality is a key predictor of which democracies are most at risk of eroding. The study offers additional evidence of the widely observed connection between democratic erosion and partisan polarization – polarization that backsliding leaders try to exacerbate. But it also calls attention to a less-recognized strategy that these leaders have for keeping voters on board in the midst of attacks on institutions: they degrade the value of their democracy’s institutions by “talking trash” about them. Post-erosion efforts at democratic repair will need to focus not just on de-polarization but on restoring confidence in institutions and countering democratic cynicism.\n← Back to all books\n\n\n\n",

Stokes \nCambridge University Press, 2019\nPurchase here\nWhy does police repression of demonstrators sometimes turn localized protests into massive, national movements? How do politicians and activists manipulate people’s emotions to get them involved? The authors of Why Bother? offer a new theory of why people take part in collective action in politics, and test it in the contexts of voting and protesting. They develop the idea that just as there are costs of participation in politics, there are also costs of abstention - intrinsic and psychological but no less real. That abstention can be psychically costly helps explain real-world patterns that are anomalies for existing theories, such as that sometimes increases in costs of participation are followed by more participation, not less. The book draws on a wealth of survey data, interviews, and experimental results from a range of countries, including the United States, Britain, Brazil, Sweden, and Turkey.\nAlso published in Spanish (Siglo XXI Editores, 2021) and Turkish (Koç University Press, 2020)\nWinner, 2020 David O.

Carey, Gretchen Helmke, Brendan Nyhan, Mitchell Sanders, and Shun Yamaya). British Journal of Political Science .\n \nPDF   Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nWhen a party or candidate loses the popular vote but still wins the election, do voters view the winner as legitimate? This scenario, known as an electoral inversion, describes the winners of two of the last six presidential elections in the United States. We report results from two experiments testing the effect of inversions on democratic legitimacy in the US context. Our results indicate that inversions significantly decrease the perceived legitimacy of winning candidates. Strikingly, this effect does not vary with the margin by which the winner loses the popular vote, nor by whether the candidate benefiting from the inversion is a co-partisan. The effect is driven by Democrats, who punish inversions regardless of candidate partisanship; few effects are observed among Republicans. These results suggest that the experience of inversions increases sensitivity to such outcomes among supporters of the losing party.\n2022. “Who will defend democracy? Evaluating tradeoffs in candidate support among partisan donors and voters” (with John Carey, Katherine Clayton, Gretchen Helmke, Brendan Nyhan, and Mitchell Sanders). Journal of Elections, Public Opinion, and Parties.\n \nPDF   Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nScholars and pundits fear that the American public’s commitment to democracy is declining and that citizens are willing to embrace candidates who would trample democratic principles. We examine whether violations of those principles generate resistance from voters and/or top campaign donors and whether such resistance extends across partisan lines. In a conjoint survey experiment, we investigate how regular Americans and donor elites trade off partisanship, policy positions, and support for democratic values when choosing between hypothetical political candidates. Our findings indicate that both citizens and donors punish candidates who endorse violations of democratic principles irrespective of the candidate’s party. However, partisans react very differently to candidates who support voter identification laws that threaten access to the franchise. This polarized response is especially strong among donors. These results suggest that the public and donors may sometimes be willing to forgive transgressions against democratic norms that align with their partisan and policy preferences.\n2020. “Presidential Rhetoric and Populism” (with Ipek Çinar and Andres Uribe). Presidential Studies Quarterly.\n\nView Abstract\n\nScholars and the general public have been struck by the norm-shattering rhetoric of President Donald J. Trump. His “rhetorical signature” is heavy with Manichean good-versus-evil messages, vilification of his opponents, and disdain for institutions and for evidence. But many politicians vilify their opponents and style themselves as uniquely able to solve their society’s problems. In fact, Trump’s Manichean discourse is typical of populist leaders, in the United States and around the world. Using text-as-data analysis of campaign rhetoric, we study the content and mood of presidential campaign speeches by a range of U.S. politicians, which allows a broader perspective not only on the uniqueness of Trump’s rhetoric, but also its continuities with the rhetoric of others. This analysis allows us to define Trump as a right-wing populist. Right-wing populists, like left-leaning ones, are anti-elitist and Manichean in words and outlook. However, the two versions of populism differ in the nature of the anti-elitism, with right-wing populists targeting political elites and left-wing ones targeting economic elites. Right-wing populists also define the “other” as ethnic out-groups, who threaten the ethnically pure “people.”\n2019. “Searching for Bright Lines in the Trump Presidency” (with John Carey, Gretchen\nHelmke, Brendan Nyhan, and Mitch Sanders). Perspectives on Politics.\n \nPDF  Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nIs American democracy under threat? The question is more prominent in political debate now than at any time in recent memory. However, it is also too blunt; there is widespread recognition that democracy is multifaceted and that backsliding, when it occurs, tends to be piecemeal. To address these concerns, we provide original data from surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of dimensions during the first year-and-a-half of the Trump presidency. We draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing. We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify potential areas of agreement—bright lines—among experts and the public about the most important democratic principles and whether they have been violated. Public and expert perceptions often differ on the importance of specific democratic principles. In addition, though our experts perceive substantial democratic erosion, particularly in areas related to checks and balances, polarization between Trump supporters and opponents undermines any social consensus recognizing these violations.\nParticipation\nWorking paper. “Why is Participation Low in Referendums? Lessons from Latin America” (with Eli Rau and Radha Sarkar). Under review.\n\nView Abstract\n\nWhether referendums, initiatives, and other mechanisms of direct democracy enhance representative systems is a matter of debate. Skeptics note — among other criticisms — that turnout tends to be low in referendums, often lower than in candidate elections in the same country. If citizens don’t care enough to participate, how useful can these mechanisms be for improving the quality of democratic systems? We argue that low referendum turnout has as much to do with parties’ disincentives to mobilize voters as with voter disinterest. Prior research on political behavior in referendums has focused largely on Europe, and assumes that voters view them as elections of lesser importance. By shifting focus to Latin America, we introduce more variation in the features of political parties that influence levels of turnout. We draw on cross-national evidence, qualitative research in Colombia, and quantitative analysis of municipal-level referendum voting behavior in Brazil. The key to understanding low voter turnout in these settings is the relatively weaker incentives that political parties have to turn out the vote when control over office is not at stake. We demonstrate that, in clientelistic systems, party operatives have particularly weak incentives to get their constituents out to the polls.\n2020. “Beyond Opportunity Costs: Campaign Messages, Anger, and Turnout among the Unemployed” (with S. Erdem Aytaç and Eli Rau). British Journal of Political Science.  \nPDF   Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nAre people under economic stress more or less likely to vote, and why? With large observational datasets and a survey experiment involving unemployed Americans, we show that unemployment depresses participation. But it does so more powerfully when the unemployment rate is low, less powerfully when it is high. Whereas earlier studies have explained lower turnout among the unemployed by stressing the especially high opportunity costs these would-be voters face, our evidence points to the psychological effects of unemployment and of campaign messages about it. When unemployment is high, challengers have an incentive to blame the incumbent, thus eliciting anger among the unemployed. Psychologists have shown anger to be an approach or mobilizing emotion. When joblessness is low, campaigns tend to ignore it. The jobless thus remain in states of depression and self-blame, which are demobilizing emotions.\n2017. “Why do People Join Backlash Movements? Lesson from Turkey” (with Erdem Aytaç\nand Luis Schiumerini). Journal of Conflict Resolution.\n\nView Abstract\n\nWhen people learn that demonstrators are being subjected to harsh treatment by the police, sometimes their reaction is to join demonstrations. What explains the potentially mobilizing power of repression? Information-oriented theories posit that repression changes people’s beliefs about the likely success of the protests or the type of the government, thus encouraging them to join. Social–psychological theories posit that repression provokes a moral and emotional reaction from bystanders, and these emotional reactions are mobilizing. Our research offers a rare opportunity to test these theories, empirically, against one another. We offer experimental evidence from Turkey after the 2013 Gezi uprising. In this setting, emotional reactions appear to be the link between repression and backlash mobilization. Information-oriented theories of backlash mobilization may be less germane in democracies, in which people already have access to information about their governments, and in highly polarized polities, in which few people’s political affinities are up for grabs.\n2017. “Protests and Repression in New Democracies” (with Erdem Aytaç\nand Luis Schiumerini). Perspectives on Politics.\n\nView Abstract\n\nElected governments sometimes deal with protests by authorizing the police to use less-lethal tools of repression: water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets, and the like. When these tactics fail to end protests and instead spark larger, backlash movements, some governments reduce the level of violence but others increase it, causing widespread injuries and loss of life. We study three recent cases of governments in new democracies facing backlash movements. Their decision to scale up or scale back police repression reflected the governments’ levels of electoral security. Secure governments with relatively unmovable majorities behind them feel freer to apply harsh measures. Less secure governments, those with volatile electoral support, contemplate that their hold on power might weaken should they inflict very harsh treatment on protesters; they have strong incentives to back down. Our original survey research and interviews with civilian authorities, police officials, and protest organizers in Turkey, Brazil, and Ukraine allow us to evaluate this explanation as well as a number of rival accounts. Our findings imply that elected governments that rest on very stable bases of support may be tempted to deploy tactics more commonly associated with authoritarian politics.\nClientelism\n2014. “Catalyst or Cause? Legislation and the Demise of Machine Politics in Britain and the United States” (with Eddie Camp and Avinash Dixit). Legislative Studies Quarterly.\n\nView Abstract\n\nIn the nineteenth century, British and American parties competed by hiring electoral agents to bribe and treat voters. British parties abruptly abandoned this practice in the 1880s. The conventional explanation is that legislation put an end to agent-mediated distribution. But this explanation leaves many questions unanswered. Why did the parties use agents for decades, even though they imposed great expense on candidates and were viewed as untrustworthy? And why, after decades of half-hearted reforms, did the House of Commons pass effective antibribery reforms only in 1883? In our formal model, parties hire agents to solve information problems, but agent-mediated distribution can be collectively suboptimal. Legislation can serve as a credibility device for shifting to less costly strategies.\n2007. “Monopoly and Monitoring: An Approach to Political Clientelism” (with Luis Fernando Medina).

Stokes, eds., Oxford Handbook of Comparative Politics, Oxford University Press.\n2005. “Perverse Accountability: A Formal Model of Machine Politics with Evidence from Argentina.” American Political Science Review.\n\nView Abstract\n\nPolitical machines (or clientelist parties) mobilize electoral support by trading particularistic benefits to voters in exchange for their votes. But if the secret ballot hides voters’ actions from the machine, voters are able to renege, accepting benefits and then voting as they choose. To explain how machine politics works, I observe that machines use their deep insertion into voters’ social networks to try to circumvent the secret ballot and infer individuals’ votes. When parties influence how people vote by threatening to punish them for voting for another party, I call this accountability. I analyze the strategic interaction between machines and voters as an iterated prisoners’ dilemma game with one-sided uncertainty. The game generates hypotheses about the impact of the machine’s capacity to monitor voters, and of voters’ incomes and ideological stances, on the effectiveness of machine politics. I test these hypotheses with data from Argentina.\n2004. “Vote Buying in Argentina” (with Valeria Brusco and Marcelo Nazareno). Latin American Research Review.\n\nView Abstract\n\nWe analyze vote buying in Argentina—the payment by political parties of minor benefits (food, clothing, cash) to citizens in exchange for their votes. How widespread is vote buying in Argentina, and what is the profile of the typical vote “seller”? Did the shift toward a neoliberal economic model in the 1990s increase or reduce vote buying? Why do parties attempt to buy votes when the ballot is secret and people could simply accept campaign handouts and then vote as they wish? We analyze responses to surveys we conducted in Argentina in 2002 and offer answers to these questions. Our findings suggest that vote buying is an effective strategy for mobilizing electoral support among low-income people when parties are able to monitor voters’ actions, make reasonably accurate inferences about how individuals voted, and credibly threaten to punish voters who defect from the implicit clientelist bargain. Our results point toward ballot reform as one way to reduce vote buying in Argentina.\nParties and Partisanship\n2010. “Democracy, Interrupted: Regime Change and Partisanship in Twentieth-Century\nArgentina” (with Noam Lupu). Electoral Studies.\n\nView Abstract\n\nElectoral volatility is much higher in new than in advanced democracies. Some scholars contend that weak partisan ties among the electorate lie behind this high volatility. Political parties in new democracies do not invest in building strong linkages with voters, they claim; hence partisanship is not widespread, nor does it grow over time. Our view is that democratic processes do encourage the spread of partisanship and hence the stabilization of electoral outcomes over time in new democracies. But this dynamic can be masked by countervailing factors and cut short by regime instability. We expect that, all else being equal, volatility will decline over time as a new democracy matures but increase again when democracy is interrupted. We use disaggregated ecological data from Argentina over nearly a century to show that electoral stability grows during democratic periods and erodes during dictatorships.\n2009. “The Social Bases of Political Parties in Argentina, 1912-2003” (with Noam Lupu). Latin American Research Review.\n\nView Abstract\n\nTo what extent has the Argentine party system been polarized along class lines? The political historiography gives mixed and contradictory answers to this question. We explore the social bases of Argentina’s political parties using an original database, the most comprehensive database of Argentine elections yet assembled, and new methods of ecological inference that yield more reliable results than previous analyses. We identify two distinct party systems, one in place between 1912 and 1940, the other emerging after 1946. The first party system was not consistently class based, but the second was, with the Radical Party representing the middle classes and the Peronists, workers and the poor. Still, there were important exceptions. Lower-class support for the Peronists, as proxied by literacy rates, declined during Perón’s exile, which implies that the party had trouble mobilizing lower-class illiterate voters. Since the return to democracy in 1983, class polarization has again found some expression in the party system.\n1999. “Political Parties and Democracy.” Annual Review of Political Science.\n\nView Abstract\n\nA central claim of democratic theory is that democracy induces governments to be responsive to the preferences of the people. Political parties organize politics in every modern democracy, and some observers claim that parties are what induce democracies to be responsive. Yet, according to others, parties give voice to extremists and reduce the responsiveness of governments to the citizenry. The debate about parties and democracy takes on renewed importance as new democracies around the globe struggle with issues of representation and governability. I show that our view of the impact of parties on democratic responsiveness hinges on what parties are—their objectives and organization. I review competing theories of parties, sketch their testable implications, and note the empirical findings that may help adjudicate among these theories. I also review debates about the origins of parties, about the determinants of party-system size and characteristics, and about party competition.\n1998. “¿Son los partidos políticos el problema de la América Latina?” Política y Gobierno.\n\nView Abstract\n\nLos estudiosos responsabilizan a los partidos políticos débiles y a los sistemas de partidos volátiles de las deficiencias de las democracias latinoamericanas. Entre éstas se encuentra la decir, la tendencia de los políticos a pronunciarse a favor de ciertas políticas durante las campañas y luego a abandonarlas una vez que están en el poder. Sin embargo, la teoría política y la experiencia de América Latina plantean expectativas contradictorias: que los partidos fuertes pueden aumentar la capacidad de respuesta y que pueden reducirla. Los estudios de caso y el análisis estadístico de datos nacionales presentados en este artículo muestran que tanto los partidos débiles en sistemas volátiles como los partidos fuertes en sistemas estables realizaron drásticos y tempranos cambios de políticas. Para comprender estos cambios, debemos ver más allá de las deficiencias de los partidos políticos. Se concluye con algunas reflexiones acerca de la conveniencia normativa de la respuesta al mandato popular.\nPolitical Economy\n2017. “When Do the Wealthy Support Redistribution? Inequality Aversion in Buenos Aires” (with Germán Feierherd and Luis Schiumerini). British Journal of Political Science.\n \nPDF   Replication\n2006. “Réditos y peligros electorales del gasto público en Argentina” (with Valeria Brusco and Marcelo Nazareno). Desarrollo Económico.\n2003. “Endogenous Democratization” (with Carles Boix). World Politics.\n\nView Abstract\n\nThe authors show that economic development increases the probability that a country will undergo a transition to democracy. These results contradict the finding of Przeworski and his associates, that development causes democracy to last but not to come into existence in the first place. By dealing adequately with problems of sample selection and model specification, the authors discover that economic growth does cause nondemocracies to democratize. They show that the effect of economic development on the probability of a transition to democracy in the hundred years between the mid-nineteenth century and World War II was substantial, indeed, even stronger than its effect on democratic stability. They also show that, in more recent decades, some countries that developed but remained dictatorships would, because of their development, be expected to democratize in as few as three years after achieving a per capita income of $12,000 per capita.\n1997. “Democratic Accountability and Policy Change: Economic Policy in Fujimori’s Peru.” Comparative Politics.\n1996. “Public Opinion and Market Reforms: The Limits of Economic Voting.” (Introduction to a special issue, Public Opinion and Market Reforms in New Democracies). Comparative Political Studies.\n\nView Abstract\n\nThe broadly held view that promarket reforms are good for most people is in conflict with the equally broadly held view that, in democracies, reforms will generate widespread resistance. Resistance is expected because reforms typically produce economic downturns, at least over the short term. Under normal circumstances, we expect citizens to withdraw support from governments during periods of economic decline. If citizens withdraw support, then governments, worried about the next election, may abandon reforms. But our expectations should be different of new democracies pursuing promarket reforms. Citizens may believe governments when they claim that things have to get worse before they get better or that economic stagnation is the fault of the past model. Research in Poland, Peru, and Mexico, reported in this special issue, supports these expectations. Hence under democracy there is more scope for support of painful reforms than frequently acknowledged.\n1996. “Economic Reform and Public Opinion in Peru, 1990-1995.” Comparative Political Studies.\n\nView Abstract\n\nEven if they are confident that prosperity lies just over the horizon, politicians who embark on promarket reforms know they are in for some stormy weather. How will they fare in voters’ eyes once the pain is felt? Will voters inevitably turn against politicians who impose painful measures without an electoral mandate to do so? The story of economic reform and public opinion in Peru under Alberto Fujimori (1990-1995) poses just these questions. The author uses monthly public opinion polls and monthly economic data to analyze the impact of economic changes during Fujimori’s reform program on opinions of the reforms and the president. The author finds that Limeños withdrew support from the program and the president when employment fell and inflation rose, responses consistent with the findings of the economic voting literature. But when real wages fell, they became optimistic about the future and more likely to support reforms and the government.\nMethods\n2014. “A Defense of Observational Research.” In Dawn Teele, ed., Field Experiments and Their Critics, Yale University Press.\n \nPDF\n2007. “Region, Contingency, and Democratization.” In Ian Shapiro, ed., Political Contingency, NYU Press.\nLatin American Politics\n2006. “Do Informal Rules Make Democracy Work?

Definitely not, at least in Latin America and many other parts of the developing world.” These words summarized an emerging revisionist view of the political character of Latin America’s new urban poor. Careful empirical research had proved wrong previous scholars and observers who had expected the new migrant populations in Latin America’s cities to become sources of support for revolutionary political movements. A new picture of the inhabitants of Latin America’s burgeoning shantytowns came into focus, showing these populations to be either passive or loyally engaged in the surrounding political system. According to this picture, squatters held considerable hope for individual advancement, forged clientelistic ties with government officials, and showed few signs of joining radicalized, class-conscious social movements.\n1991. “Hegemony, Consciousness, and Political Change in Peru.” Politics and Society.\nOther\n2018. “Accountability for Realists.” Critical Review.\n\nView Abstract\n\nIn Democracy for Realists, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue that voters are shortsighted and punish incumbents for politically irrelevant outcomes. These failings, in the authors’ view, mean that voters are incapable of holding politicians to account. But Achen and Bartels overstate voters’ failure to engage in effective retrospective voting. The authors also understate the degree to which accountability can be compatible with voters’ being myopic, such as when early- and late-term performance are correlated. Achen and Bartels also overlook evidence that the American state acted as an insurer against social risk long before the New Deal, a fact that points to voters using relevant criteria (not irrelevant ones) when they appear to punish incumbents for natural disasters. Finally, while accountability is an important consequentialist reason for democracy, we should keep in mind non-consequentialist justifications for this system of government, in particular its instantiation of political equality.\n2003. “Democracy and Representation: Comments on ‘Democratic Representation: Two Contributions from Comparative Politics’ by G. Bingham Powell, Jr.” In Edward D. Mansfield and Richard Sisson, eds., The Evolution of Political Knowledge, The Ohio State University Press.\n1998. “Constituency Influence and Representation.” Electoral Studies.\n\nView Abstract\n\nIn their classic study “Constituency Influence in Congress”, Miller and Stokes (1966) equated representation with responsiveness to constituent opinion. But when constituents are uncertain about the effects of policies and when they may come to favor a policy which they opposed before its implementation, politicians may represent constitutent’s interests even though they are unresponsive to their ex ante preferences. Several Latin American governments that switched to unpopular policies early in their terms did so because they thought citizens were ill-informed and their preferences would change. Even though we should consider such policy switches as carried out by governments that are attempting to represent, we should not return to a Burkean ideal whereby legislators do what they deem best regardless of the will of their constituents.\n1998. “Pathologies of Deliberation.” In Jon Elster, ed., Deliberative Democracy, Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n\n",
